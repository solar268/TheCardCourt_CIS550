# TheCardCourt_CIS550

**TheCardCourt** is an innovative project developed by Luke Schalles, Jay Moon, Armaan Rathi, and Sean Chuang for CIS550. This project aims to leverage extensive NBA statistics, sourced from Kaggle and the NBA Advanced Statistics website, to create engaging applications that basketball fans and data enthusiasts will love.

Our dataset spans from 2004 to 2022, including detailed game data, player statistics, and team information. With this rich dataset, we propose two main applications:

1. **NBA Card Game Application**: Transforming NBA player statistics into a dynamic trading card game. Players can collect, trade, and compete using cards that reflect real-world performance metrics.
2. **NBA Fantasy League Application**: A platform allowing users to craft fantasy teams with real NBA players. Compete in a simulated season based on historical performance data.

# Key Features:
- **Card Strength and Team Packs**: In the card game, player stats determine card rarity and strength. Users can collect cards from specific teams, enhancing the collectible aspect.
- **Competition and Team Draft**: Both applications feature competition elements, whether through card battles or fantasy league matchups, with outcomes based on real statistical performance.
- **Statistical Queries**: Support for complex queries allows users to identify top scorers, rebound leaders, assist leaders, three-point specialists, most improved players, and key defensive players.

Stay tuned for updates as we develop these concepts into fully functional applications that bring NBA statistics to life in new and exciting ways!
